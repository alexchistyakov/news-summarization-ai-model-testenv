    "Alaska Airlines has begun flying Boeing 737 Max 9 jetliners again since they were grounded after a panel blew out of the side of one of the airline's planes. The airline said in a statement that it has completed its final inspection of their group of the aircraft. They said they resumed flying the Max 9 with a flight from Seattle to San Diego on Friday afternoon. On Wednesday, the Federal Aviation Administration approved the inspection and maintenance process to return the planes to flying. Technicians at Alaska began inspections that night, the airline said. The airline said they expect inspections to be completed by the end of next week, allowing the airline to operate a full flight schedule. Inspections are expected to take up to 12 hours per aircraft. \"Each of our 737-9 MAX will return to service only after the rigorous inspections are completed and each plane is deemed airworthy according to FAA requirements,\" the airline said in a written statement Friday. The first United passenger flight on a Boeing MAX 9 since the panel blew out on the Alaska Airlines flight departed from Newark, New Jersey, to Las Vegas Saturday morning. The flight carried 175 passengers and six crew members. Boeing Commercial Airplanes president and CEO Stan Deal said in a message to Boeing employees Friday that the company’s most immediate goal is to help airlines restore operations \"Our long-term focus is on improving our quality so that we can regain the confidence of our customers, our regulator and the flying public,\" he wrote. \"Frankly, we have disappointed and let them down. We are deeply sorry for the significant disruption and frustration for our customers, some of whom have been publicly and unfairly criticized,\" he added. The Federal Aviation Administration has detailed the process that airlines must follow to inspect — and if necessary, repair — the panels called door plugs, one of which broke loose on Alaska Airlines flight 1282 on Jan. 5. The plugs are used to seal holes left for extra doors on the Max 9 when an unusually high number of seats requires more exits for safety reasons. Alaska Airlines grounded all 65 of its Max 9 jets within hours after one of the two door plugs in the back half of the cabin of flight 1282 blew away while 16,000 feet (about 4,900 meters) above Oregon. The FAA grounded all Max 9s in the U.S. the day after the blowout. No passengers were seriously injured.\"",
    "Reddit (REDDIT) is considering a valuation of at least $5B, according to a Bloomberg report that cites people familiar with the matter. The company is looking for a valuation of mid-single-digit billions in a debut that could come as soon as March, Bloomberg reported. Much will depend on the new-issues market and the timing of the deal. Reddit was valued at about $10B in a funding round in 2021, and aims to sell about 10% of its shares in the IPO, according to a Reuters report. In March 2022, the social media company had selected banks to help it prepare for an IPO, but was sidelined by the Federal Reserve's rate hikes and risk-off market sentiment that followed. Reddit is a competitor with a variety of websites and platforms for social media attention such as Tumblr, Quora, Instagram and Facebook, owned by Meta Platforms (META), ByteDance (BDNCE) -owned TikTok, and X, formerly known as Twitter. The company intends to make its public filing in late February, introduce its roadshow in early March, and complete the IPO by the end of March, Reuters said.",
    "Expectations that the Fed would begin easing monetary policy as early as March after its fastest tightening cycle in four decades have helped fuel a rally in U.S. stock- and bond-markets. Investors now mostly expect five or six quarter-point rate cuts by December, bringing the fed-funds rate down to around 4-4.25% from the current range of 5.25-5.5%, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.  See: Economic growth underlined by fourth-quarter GDP reinforces Fed’s cautious approach to rate cuts While no interest-rate change is expected for the central bank’s first policy meeting this year, some market analysts think comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell during his news conference on Wednesday are likely to shift the market’s expectations and push back against forecasts of a March cut.  Thierry Wizman, global FX and interest rates strategist at Macquarie, said a stock-market rally, \"too-dovish\" signals from the Fed’s December meeting, a still-resilient labor market and escalating Middle East conflicts may indicate that Powell has to keep the \"[monetary] tightening bias\" next week.  The rally in the stock market could \"conceivably backfire\" by virtue of a loosening of financial conditions, while the labor market has not weakened to the extent that the Fed officials would have hoped, Wizman told MarketWatch in a phone interview on Friday. Further complicating things, fears that inflation could spike again in light of the conflict in the Middle East and Red Sea could reinforce Fed’s cautious approach to rate cuts, he said.  Meanwhile, a shift to \"neutral bias\" doesn’t automatically mean that the Fed will cut the policy rate soon since the Fed still needs to go to \"easing bias\" before actually trimming rates, Wizman said. \"I think the market gets too dovish and does not realize the Fed has very, very good reasons to push this [the first rate cut] out to June.\"",
    "Tech behemoths will face their next test to keep the market’s throne this week, after a bleak quarter from Tesla sent its stock sliding. Tesla shares have tumbled more than 26% so far in 2024 after the electric-vehicle maker reported a fourth-quarter operating margin that has almost halved to 8.2% from the year-earlier period. Tesla also warned that it expects slower sales growth this year. That comes as the rest of the \"Magnificent Seven\" — Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, Apple and Alphabet — continue climbing higher. Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Alphabet shares closed at record levels several times last week. Now, they face their own tests. Microsoft and Alphabet report earnings on Tuesday, with Amazon, Meta Platforms and Apple to follow on Thursday. Nvidia reports quarterly results on February 21. Excluding Tesla, the Magnificent Seven is projected to report an aggregate 53.7% fourth-quarter earnings growth from the prior year, according to FactSet. Companies in the S&P 500 index are expected to report a 10.5% earnings decline minus those six firms. The Magnificent Seven’s quarterly results will be some of the most-watched this earnings season, due to the outsized influence the group has had over the broader market since last year. The returns in the Magnificent Seven drove about 62% of the benchmark index’s 26% total return last year, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. Some investors say that while it’s unclear whether the elite tech cohort will continue its reign as the market’s top brass this year, it will be difficult for the stocks to repeat their blockbuster gains from 2023. \"You’re coming in to a tougher and higher bar this year,\" said Saira Malik, chief investment officer at Nuveen. \"That will be the headwind to returns this year for tech.\" Investors crowded into mega-cap tech stocks last year after the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022 prompted a flurry of artificial excitement. While the market rally broadened in late 2023 as optimism swirled that the Federal Reserve would soon start cutting rates, Wall Street still didn’t retire its old playbook. So far this year, the S&P 500 and Dow industrials indexes have reached all-time highs and topped their closing records several times over. So has the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100. But the Russell 2000 index, which tracks the performance of US small-cap stocks, is down 2.4% for the year compared to the S&P 500 index’s 2.5% gain. The S&P 500 equal-weighted index, which gives every stock the same influence over its performance, has fallen 0.4%. The \"Magnificent Seven\" excluding Tesla has a combined market cap of roughly $12 trillion, according to Bespoke Investment Group data through Wednesday’s close. That’s equivalent to over 65% of the Russell 2000’s market cap. Shelby McFaddin, investment analyst at Motley Fool Asset Management, said she will home in on cash flow when parsing quarterly earnings reports from big tech companies this week. Her firm owns all of the Magnificent Seven stocks except for Tesla. \"You can model out top-line growth until you’re blue in the face, but eventually, you run out. It can’t be infinite. So, if you’re doing AI, what does it do?\" said McFaddin. \"That’s what everyone has to answer to, because there’s a lot of aspiration in a lot of these valuations.\" Some investors say that the Magnificent Seven could extend their dominance even if the Federal Reserve doesn’t cut interest rates as expected, thanks to their status as one of Wall Street’s favorite defensive plays. Investors sought out big tech stocks last year during turbulent times like the regional banking crisis, figuring that their flush balance sheets and AI involvement made them dependable havens. The Fed has projected three rate cuts for 2024, and data released so far this year suggests the economy remains resilient against rates currently hovering around a 23-year high. Still, that doesn’t guarantee continued strength in markets. \"My concern is more towards the tail end of the year. Advertisers — is there going to be the demand? Are we heading into a recession? I don’t know,\" said Joe Mazzola, director of trader education at Charles Schwab.",
    "HONG KONG, Jan 29 (Reuters) - A Hong Kong court on Monday ordered the liquidation of property giant China Evergrande Group (3333.HK), opens new tab, a move likely to send ripples through China's crumbling financial markets as policymakers scramble to contain a deepening crisis. Justice Linda Chan decided to liquidate the world's most indebted developer, with more than $300 billion of total liabilities, after noting Evergrande had been unable to offer a concrete restructuring plan more than two years after defaulting on a bond repayment and after several court hearings. \"It is time for the court to say enough is enough,\" said Chan, who will give her detailed reasoning later on Monday. Evergrande chief executive Siu Shawn told Chinese media the company will ensure home building projects will still be delivered despite the liquidation order. The order would not affect the operations of Evergrande's onshore and offshore units, he added. The decision sets the stage for what is expected to be drawn-out and complicated process with potential political considerations, given the many authorities involved. Offshore investors will be focused on how Chinese authorities treat foreign creditors when a company fails. \"It is time for the court to say enough is enough,\" said Chan, who will give her detailed reasoning later on Monday.

The decision sets the stage for what is expected to be drawn-out and complicated process with potential political considerations, given the many authorities involved. Offshore investors will be focused on how Chinese authorities treat foreign creditors when a company fails. Evergrande's shares were trading down as much as 20% before the hearing. Trading was halted in China Evergrande and its listed subsidiaries China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group (0708.HK), opens new tab and Evergrande Property Services (6666.HK), opens new tab after the verdict. Evergrande, which has $240 billion of assets, sent a struggling property sector into a tailspin when it defaulted on its debt in 2021 and the liquidation ruling will likely further jolt already fragile Chinese capital and property markets. Beijing is grappling with an underperforming economy, its worst property market in nine years and a stock market wallowing near five-year lows, so any fresh jolt to investor confidence could further undermine policymakers' efforts to rejuvenate growth. Evergrande applied for another adjournment on Monday as its lawyer said it had made \"some progress\" on the restructuring proposal. In the latest offer, the developer proposed creditors swap their debts into all the shares the company holds in its two Hong Kong units, compared to stakes of about 30% in the subsidiaries ahead of the last hearing in December. Evergrande's lawyer argued liquidation could harm the operations of the company, and its property management and electric vehicle units, which would in turn hurt the group's ability to repay all creditors. Evergrande had been working on a $23 billion debt revamp plan with a group of creditors known as the ad hoc bondholder group for almost two years. \"We're not surprised by the outcome and it's a product of the company failing to engage with the ad hoc group,\" said Fergus Saurin, a Kirkland & Ellis partner who had advised the offshore bondholders. \"There has been a history of last minute engagement which has gone nowhere. And in the circumstances, the company only has itself to blame for being wound up.\" Evergrande cited a Deloitte analysis during a Hong Kong court hearing in July that estimated a recovery rate of 3.4% if the developer were liquidated. After Evergrande said in September its flagship unit and its chairman Hui Ka Yan were being investigated by the authorities for unspecified crimes, creditors now expect a recovery rate of less than 3%. The ruling is expected to have little impact on the company's operations including home construction projects in the near term, as it could take months or years for the offshore liquidator appointed by the creditors to take control of subsidiaries across mainland China - a different jurisdiction from Hong Kong. The liquidation petition was first filed in June 2022 by Top Shine, an investor in Evergrande unit Fangchebao which said the developer had failed to honour an agreement to repurchase shares it had bought in the subsidiary. Before Monday, at least three Chinese developers have been ordered by a Hong Kong court to liquidate since the current debt crisis unfolded in mid-2021."
